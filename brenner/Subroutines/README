The subdirectories contain source code organized according to 
the function of the code: 

General: general routines needed for the simulation
Special: specialized routines, such as those needed to move a tip
         or generate a shock wave, are stored here as they are 
         developed
Bond_Order: routines for the bond-order potential
Lennard_Jones: routines for the Lennard-Jones potential
Tight_Binding: routines for the tight-binding potential
EAM: routines for the embedded-atom method
