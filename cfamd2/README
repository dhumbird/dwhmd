IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:  md2 is NOT a commercial code!! It
was developed as an academic research tool, and is being
published via the Web in conjunction with the publication
of my PhD thesis.  I make NO GUARANTEES about the accuracy
of md2 or any of its affiliated programs.  I assume NO
RESPONSIBILITY WHATSOEVER for any results that others may
obtain using md2 or its affiliated programs.

This README file accompanies the 22 Feb release of the md2
molecular dynamics simulation code.  If you have unpacked
the md2.tar.gz file in its own subdirectory, you should
now see the following files:

args.c
atom.c
bicubic.c
cfg.c
chem.c
clust.c
cryst.c
dblmat.c
domd.c
ion.c
point.c
push.c
tbt_sicf.c
tricubic.c
main.c
args.h
atom.h
bicubic.h
cfg.h
chem.h
clust.h
cryst.h
dblmat.h
domd.h
ion.h
point.h
push.h
tbt_sicf.h
tricubic.h
units.h
sicf_params.h
tricof.h
genforce.h
cfg2r3d.c
colormap.c
r3d_utils.c
colormap.h
r3d_utils.h
README
manual.ps
aSi.cfg
makefile.sgi
makefile.linux

The first step is to print out the manual.ps file, which is a sort
of bare-bones user's manual and tutorial for the md2 code, along
with some very minimal developer-oriented documentation.  Within
this manual are all of the instructions necessary to compile
and run md2 and its auxiliary programs.
