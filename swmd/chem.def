# chem.def
# This file contains the physical properties to be used for each chemical
# species. If nothing is specified for a particular species, the program
# will use hard-coded defaults.
#
# Any line beginning with a "#" will be ignored. The format of the file is
# as follows:
#
# id	mass	squared_cutoff	three_body
#
# where: 	id is the atomic number of the species
#		mass is in amu
#		squared_cutoff is the cutoff radius in Ang, squared
#		three_body is 1 if the species has a three-body potential,
#				0 otherwise.
